HackNC-2014
===========

HackNC project

Our project for HackNC 3/1/2014-3/2/2014. It is a laser tripwire system that sends an email via SendGrid to the user to alert a physical breach. It also sends an alert if the temperature is high enough such that the security system suspects a fire. Other features that may or may not exist include a translate option that translate the email into random languages for it being sent and a payment feature that donates one BitCoin for every tripwire activation.
